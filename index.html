        <div class="text_column_right"><p>Hi everyone! My name is Steven, I am 37 and live in Brussels (Molenbeek) with my girlfriend and our (very talkative!) ginger tomcat, Cassius.</p>
          <p>I am more than excited to start this new journey to become a functional analyst.</p>

      <div class="about_me" id="work_experience">
        <div class="text_column_left"><p>The past five and a half years I have been working at Belgian cybersecurity company, <a href="https://www.guardsquare.com/en" target="_blank">Guardsquare</a>, specializing in the protection of mobile applications against reverse engineering and tampering. I was one of the first employees of the company, which, in good old startup fashion, means I have been involved in about every single aspect of the business, from doing admin and sales, to building teams and managing people, to managing the development of internal systems.</p>
        <p>After the first crazy years, I took on the role of product marketeer. My main task was to channel information from the engineering team to the sales and marketing teams (product training, product positioning) and the other way around (flagging customer needs and opportunities).</p>

        <div class="subtitle_column_left"><h3>What I studied</h3></div>
        <div class="text_column_right"><p>I studied Germanic languages (Dutch - German) and have a PhD in Literature. The last point has proven to be a great source of hilarity for the people I have met throughout my professional career - hilarity that tends to grow even stronger when people find out I studied comics.</p>
          <p>I have always found that there isn’t as much of a gap between my studies and my subsequent professional career as most people seem to think. I am a specialist in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narratology" target="_blank">narratology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics" target="_blank">semiotics</a>, two quite analytical disciplines. I tend to say that I reverse engineered stories to understand how they are made and processed by the reader.</p>
          <p>Here are two blogs I wrote a while back to give you an idea of what my research involved: <a href="https://comicsforum.org/2012/05/25/image-narrative-4-blacks-and-blanks-on-empty-panels-by-steven-surdiacourt/" target="_blank">On 'empty' panels</a> and <a href="https://comicsforum.org/2012/06/21/image-narrative-5-graphic-poetry-an-impossible-form-by-steven-surdiacourt/" target="_blank">Graphic poetry</a>.</p>

      <div class="about_me" id="hobbies">
        <div class="text_column_left"><p>My favorite pastime is - unsurprisingly - reading. I try to alternate between French, German and English when reading and am interested in both fiction and non-fiction (philosophy, art, sociology, political theory, etc.)</p>
          <p>In addition to this, I am a fervent dancer. Once the pandemic is behind us, you will definitely find me at one of Brussels frequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VuKZmpH4ew" target="_blank">folk bals</a> or forró parties.</p>
